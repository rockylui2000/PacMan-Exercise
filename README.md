# PacMan Exercise
 PacMan on the move
 
Description of Project:
This project allows user to creat one or more PacMan by clicking on certain button. The Pacman will start moving by another button is pressed.

How to Run:
When button "make one" is pressed, a new PacMan is created.
When button "game" is pressed.the Pacman will be moving randomly and can bounce off the wall of your browser. 

Roadmap of future improvements:
I plan to create random colors to the Pacman when it changes its route on the screen. Moreover, I plan to add special sound effects when Pacman hits the wall boundary or when 2 PacMen collide with each other.
